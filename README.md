# DS-Task-1
Excited to share my latest project as a Data Science intern at Prodigy Infotech! Delving into the fascinating realm of color schemes within Seaborn libraries and beyond has been an enriching experience. From understanding the impact of colors on data visualization to crafting visually appealing plots, this project has allowed me to hone my skills and explore new horizons in the field of data science. As a Data Scientist, mastering Python has been instrumental in unlocking a world of possibilities, from data manipulation and analysis to building powerful machine learning models. Leveraging Google Colab for this project has enhanced my collaboration and productivity, enabling seamless integration of code and data analysis. Join me on this colorful journey filled with insights and discoveries! ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š #DataScience #ProdigyInfotech #Seaborn #DataVisualization #Python #GoogleColab
